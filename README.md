- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ncardozo - @ncardoz - @ncardozo@fediscience.org - @ncardozo@bsky.social
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the design and implementation of programming languages, as well as in the analysis, validation, and verification of different (distributed) software properties
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on different reserach projects to enable the validation/verification of software systems focusing on: (1) validation of adaptive systems, (2) verification of distributed systems, (3) validation/verification of RL programs, and (4) design an implementation of tools and languages for quantum programs. Additionally, I'm building analysis tools for RL systems, as a means to improve the programming experience.
